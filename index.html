        <p>Hello my name is Ornela Mbanga  and i'm from Congo Brazzaville, "I'm proud to be learning programming on my journey to becoming a web developer. Technology shapes our future, and I believe it's essential that more girls, especially in my country, are encouraged to explore this field. I hope to inspire others to see that coding is not just for some â€” itâ€™s for everyone, and it opens doors to endless possibilities."
