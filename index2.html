            <p>Hello my name is Ornela Mbanga, and I'm from Congo-Brazzaville. I'm truly excited to begin my journey into the world of programming.
               Even though I'm just starting out, I feel deeply inspired by the power of technology to change lives and build the future. I believe that programming is more than just code it'ss creativity, logic, and innovation combined.
               I'm passionate about learning, growing, and challenging myself every step of the way. My dream is to use my skills to make a positive impact in my community and beyond.
                This is just the beginning for me, and I'm proud to be on this journey. I'm ready to learn, create, and shine in the world of tech</p>

            <h2> Congo-Brazzaville</h2>
            <img src="" alt="">
            <p>Brazzaville is the capital of the Republic of Congo, located on the right bank of the majestic Congo River, 
             directly across from Kinshasa  making it one of the few cities in the world to face another country' s capital across a river. 
             Founded in 1880 by the explorer Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza, the city has a rich history, even serving as the capital of Free France 
             in Africa during World War II. Today, Brazzaville is full of life, art, culture, and music  especially the famous Congolese rumba. 
             Places like the MarchÃ© Total, the Poto-Poto neighborhood with its renowned art school, the stunning Sainte-Anne Basilica, and the scenic 
             Congo River banks all reflect the city's vibrance. But beyond the landmarks, 
             it's the people who make Brazzaville shine â€” a young generation full of talent, ambition, and 
             creativity, embracing technology, fashion, music, and entrepreneurship. Brazzaville is a strong, warm, 
             and forward-looking city, where young people can dream big, build boldly, and succeed with pride. It's more than a capital it's a heartbeat for Africa.
